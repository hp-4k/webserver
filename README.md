WEBSERVER
=========

This project completes the "Ruby on the Web" chapter of [The Odin Project](www.theodingproject.com) tutorial.

The simple server in server.rb runs on localhost listening on port 2000. It accepts GET and POST HTTP requests, processes sent data and generates adequate responses utilising pre-written html templates. On the other hand, the browser produces valid HTTP requests and sends them to the server. The two scripts communicate using Ruby sockets.
